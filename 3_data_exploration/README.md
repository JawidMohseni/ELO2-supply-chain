# Global Supply Chain Data Exploration  

## What We Discovered About Our Shipping Performance

Over the past three years, we've been tracking how long it takes to get products
from our warehouse to customers around the world. We looked at every shipment
from 2015 through 2017. Here's what we found about where things are running
smoothly and where we're hitting roadblocks.

### The Big Picture: How We're Doing Overall

Across all shipments, delivery performance varies widely:

- Many shipments arrive on time or early  
- Many shipments arrive late  
- Some deliveries arrive extremely late, exceeding 100 days  
- Delays range from early deliveries (negative delay) to very large late deliveries

All delays are based on **actual shipment date minus scheduled shipment days**.

### Where in the World We're Having the Most Trouble

#### **Oceania and Latin America Experience the Highest Delays**

- These regions show the **highest average delivery delays**
- Delays are consistent across multiple product categories  
- Long-distance shipping and infrastructure limitations likely contribute  

#### **Parts of Asia Also Face Delivery Delays**

- Several Asian regions experience persistent late deliveries  
- Delays vary by product category and shipping method  

---

### Where We're Doing Well

#### **North America - Strong Performance**

- Many shipments arrive on time or early  
- Reliable transportation and warehouse infrastructure support performance  

#### **Europe - Generally Stable**

- Delivery performance is mostly consistent  
- Fewer extreme delays compared to other regions  

---

### Which Shipping Methods Work Best

#### **Shipment Mode Performance**

- **First Class**: Frequently shows positive delays  
- **Same Day**: Often arrives early  
- **Standard and Second Class**: Mixed performance with early and late deliveries

This shows that **faster shipment labels do not always guarantee faster delivery**.

---

### Which Products Are Hardest to Deliver On Time

#### **Strength Training Products**

- Show the highest average delivery delays  
- Likely affected by bulk handling and supply constraints  

#### **Music Products**

- Frequently experience late deliveries  
- Likely affected by sourcing and supplier logistics  

#### **Fitness Accessories**

- Also experience high average delays  
- Sensitive to handling and fulfillment timing  

---

### Our Best-Moving Products

Several products consistently arrive on time or early, especially:

- Lightweight apparel  
- Standard footwear items  
- Products with simpler packaging and handling requirements  

---

### When Timing Matters Most

Time-based analysis shows that:

- Delivery delays fluctuate across different months  
- Certain periods experience higher average delays due to shipping volume and capacity
- Seasonal demand likely contributes to delivery variability  

---

### What's Working Well in Our Operations

#### **Warehouse Performance**

- **Puerto Rico warehouse shows higher average delays**
- **U.S. mainland warehouse performs more efficiently**
- This indicates a major operational bottleneck at the Puerto Rico warehouse

### What We Should Do Now

#### **Quick Fixes (Next Few Weeks)**

1. Prioritize high-delay regions for faster shipment methods  
2. Review shipment routing for long-distance deliveries  
3. Improve communication with customers in high-risk delivery zones  
4. Monitor warehouse congestion more closely  
5. Track high-delay product categories more frequently  

#### **Medium-Term Improvements (Next Few Months)**

1. Explore regional warehouse expansion  
2. Improve supplier coordination for delayed product categories  
3. Strengthen shipment tracking systems  
4. Develop regional delivery optimization strategies  
5. Improve operational planning for peak seasons  

#### **Longer-Term Changes (Next Year)**

1. Consider multiple warehouse locations  
2. Implement predictive delay modeling  
3. Develop carrier performance evaluation systems  
4. Improve seasonal staffing strategies  
5. Strengthen long-term customer communication systems

### What We Know and What We're Still Learning

**What We're Confident About:**

- We have three years of solid delivery data  
- Our tracking is consistent across all regions  
- Delay calculation is based on actual shipment performance  
- We have strong geographic coverage  

**What We're Still Figuring Out:**

- Exact root causes of extreme delays  
- Financial impact of long delivery times  
- How current market conditions compare to historical data  
- How delays directly affect customer satisfaction  

---

### Next Steps for Our Team

#### **Immediate Actions (Starting Now)**

- Operations team: Use these findings for planning  
- Customer service: Improve delivery transparency  
- Management: Review high-risk delivery regions and warehouse performance  

#### **Coming Soon**

- Deeper route-level delay investigation  
- Cost impact analysis by product category  
- Development of improved delay forecasting tools

### How to Use This Information

**For Our Operations Team:**

- Monitor regional performance trends  
- Use monthly patterns for logistics planning  
- Adjust shipment strategies based on real delay behavior  

**For Our Management:**

- Support warehouse improvement decisions  
- Strengthen long-term supply chain planning  
- Improve supplier and carrier coordination  

**For Customer-Facing Teams:**

- Set realistic expectations for delayed regions  
- Understand which products tend to arrive late  
- Use data-backed delivery communication  

This analysis gives us a clear picture of where we're doing well and where we
need to improve. The good news is that we now have solid data to make better
decisions and serve our customers more reliably.
