## Asking for Help

To balance independent learning and team efficiency, we follow this guideline:

1. **0 → 30 minutes**: Try to solve the problem independently  
2. **30 → 60 minutes**: Ask your teammate for help in Slack  
3. **60+ minutes**: Contact instructors or coaches through Slack or GitHub

This approach helps maintain steady progress while encouraging problem-solving skills.
