# Collaboration

This project was completed by a two-person team as part of the MIT Emerging
Talent program. Our collaboration was built on respect, clear communication,
 shared responsibility, and flexibility due to different schedules and time zones.

always welcome, and challenges were discussed honestly. We trusted each other
to work independently while staying aligned through regular updates.

and major alignment.

## ⏰ Time & Availability

Because we worked across different schedules, availability sometimes overlapped
and sometimes did not. We managed this by:

- Communicating availability in advance  
- Dividing tasks based on time and strengths  
- Being flexible and patient when responses were delayed

## 🤝 Trust & Responsibility

Each team member:

- Took full ownership of their work  
- Met agreed deadlines whenever possible  
- Communicated early when issues appeared  
- Supported the other during difficult technical tasks  

This trust-based collaboration helped us successfully complete:

- Data cleaning  
- Delay calculations  
- Nine core visualizations  
- Time-series and correlation analysis  
- Full documentation and reporting
