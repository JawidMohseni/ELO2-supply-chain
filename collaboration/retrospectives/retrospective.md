# 📘 Project Retrospective — Global Supply Chain Delay Analysis

This retrospective summarizes our experience working as a two-person team on the
 Global Supply Chain Delay Visualization project. It reflects what went well,
 what we struggled with, and the key lessons we learned throughout the process.

---

## 🔴 Stop Doing

- Starting analysis before fully understanding the dataset structure.
- Spending too long fixing small code issues instead of stepping back to reassess
  our plan.
- Assuming extreme delay values were errors without validating them.
- Pushing code before double-checking column names (which caused repeated `KeyError`s).

---

## 🟢 Continue Doing

- Collaborating consistently through Slack and scheduling Zoom calls when deeper
   discussion was needed.
- Helping each other debug code, fix visualizations, and align analysis decisions.
- Dividing tasks clearly (data cleaning, visualizing, documentation,
  explanation writing).
- Using shared documents to track notes, decisions, and blockers.
- Reviewing each other’s contributions before finalizing notebooks and READMEs.

---

## 🟡 Start Doing

- Creating a clear step‑by‑step analysis plan before jumping into coding.
- Verifying the meaning and format of each dataset column early to avoid confusion.
- Using GitHub Issues to track tasks instead of relying mostly on chat messages.
- Preparing small meeting agendas to make Zoom discussions more focused and efficient.

---

## 📘 Lessons Learned

- Delay values should be used exactly as they appear—even the extreme
   ones—because they reflect real-world complexity.
- Including early, on-time, and late deliveries gives a more accurate and fair
   evaluation of supply chain performance.
- Correlation analysis doesn’t always reveal strong patterns; delays can
   depend on factors not captured in the dataset.
- Visualizations such as time‑series charts and geographic maps reveal insights
  that raw tables cannot.
- With only two team members, clear and steady communication becomes even more important.

## ✔️ Overall Reflection

Despite challenges with inconsistent column names, unclear date formats, and
 unexpected delay values, we successfully completed a full and meaningful
 analysis.  
We produced strong visualizations, identified real insights, and strengthened
our teamwork and technical skills.

Working as a small two-person team required flexibility, constant
communication, and quick problem-solving — and in the end, the project
 became more focused, efficient, and cohesive.
