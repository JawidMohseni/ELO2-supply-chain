# Domain Research: Visualizing Delay Risks in the Global Supply Chain

## Background

Global supply chains are networks that move products from warehouses to
customers around the world. Each shipment goes through many steps, and delays
can happen at any point. Delays can cost money, affect customer satisfaction,
and make the supply chain less efficient

The idea is to create a visualization that shows **the journey of a product
through the supply chain** and highlights **where delays happen and why**.
This helps businesses understand problems in their global operations and make
better decisions.

## Problem Statement

Even though companies have a lot of data about shipments, it is often hard to see
 **where and why delays happen**. Without clear visualizations, it’s difficult
 to fix problems or plan better. We need tools that can show **delay risks across
 different stages of the global supply chain**, using factors like shipment type,
  region, and product category.

## Main Research Question

**How can data visualization reveal delay risks across different stages of the
global supply chain?**

## Supporting Research Questions

1. Which regions or shipping routes are most likely to have delays?  
2. How do different shipment modes (air, sea, standard, express) affect delays?
3. Are certain product types more likely to be delayed?  
4. How do seasons or months affect shipment delays globally?  
5. What visualization methods best show delay risks to stakeholders?

## Data Source

- **Dataset:** [Supply Chain Analytic — Just-In-Time Company](https://github.com/hoshigan/Supply-Chain-Analytic---Just-In-Time-Company?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Includes:**  
  - Warehouse and customer locations (countries and regions)  
  - Shipment modes (air, sea, express, standard)  
  - Shipment dates  
  - Product categories and names  

This dataset will help us **map global routes, analyze delay risks, and create
visualizations** to show patterns in shipment delays.

**Summary:**  
This project focuses on using **visualizations** to show **where and why delays
happen** in global supply chains. The goal is to help analysts and businesses
understand patterns, predict potential delays, and improve efficiency.
